        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What makes this app different from other diet apps? 🎮</h3>
            <p>We're the only nutrition app with authentic Pokemon gamification, multiple AI providers (GPT-4, Grok, Perplexity, Ollama), and a research-grade MCP server with PubMed integration. Your Pokemon companions actually evolve based on your eating habits, and you battle wild Pokemon triggered by your step count!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do the multiple AI providers work? 🤖</h3>
            <p>Our intelligent system uses GPT-4 Vision for superior food image analysis, Grok 4 for real-time restaurant data, Perplexity for global nutrition information, and local Ollama for privacy-focused analysis. If one provider fails, it automatically falls back to others, ensuring you always get results.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>What is the MCP server and why is it special? 🔬</h3>
            <p>Our Model Context Protocol server runs advanced multi-agent AI analysis with access to PubMed research, predictive health analytics, and evidence-based recommendations. It's like having a team of nutrition researchers analyzing your data 24/7, providing insights far beyond simple calorie counting.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How does the Pokemon gamification work? 🐾</h3>
            <p>Choose from custom starter Pokemon (Dracowave, Lunafang, Pyrosaur, etc.) that evolve based on your eating consistency. Your daily steps from HealthKit trigger Fire Red-style Pokemon battles with wild encounters. It's authentic Pokemon mechanics applied to nutrition tracking!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can it really generate recipes from my fridge photos? 👨‍🍳</h3>
            <p>Yes! Photo your ingredients and our AI identifies what you have, then generates personalized recipes adapted to your cooking skill level, available time, dietary restrictions, and current nutritional goals. It even considers the time of day and your remaining calorie budget.</p>
